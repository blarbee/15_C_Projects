# 15_C_Projects


1. **Calculator**: A simple command-line program for performing basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

2. **To-Do List Manager**: A program to manage and organize tasks, allowing users to add, remove, and list tasks. It's a good exercise in data management.

3. **Text-Based Games**: Projects like Hangman or Tic-Tac-Toe are introductory games that help you learn input/output, conditionals, and loops in C.

4. **File Explorer**: Create a basic program that allows users to navigate directories, list files, and perform file operations like copying, moving, and deleting.

5. **Text Editor**: A command-line text editor that enables users to create, edit, and save text documents. It's a step towards more complex applications.

6. **Weather App**: Develop an application that fetches weather data from an online API and displays it to the user, teaching you about API requests and data parsing.

7. **Password Manager**: Build a secure command-line program for storing and retrieving passwords, using encryption to secure data.

8. **Chat Application**: Create a simple chat application for the command line, allowing users to connect and exchange messages over a network.

9. **Music Player**: Design a console-based music player that plays audio files in various formats. It introduces you to audio processing and libraries.

10. **Chess Engine**: If you're interested in chess, try building a chess engine in C. It involves implementing chess rules and a basic AI to play against.

11. **Basic Compiler or Interpreter**: Develop a basic programming language compiler or interpreter. This is a challenging project that includes lexing, parsing, and executing code.

12. **Simulation Game**: Create a simple simulation game, such as a virtual pet or a city-building game. These can be entertaining and educational to develop.

13. **Data Structures and Algorithms**: Implement various data structures (e.g., linked lists, trees, graphs) and algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching) to deepen your understanding of these fundamental concepts.

14. **Graphics Library**: Build a simple graphics library that can draw basic shapes and images to the screen, teaching you graphics programming in C.

15. **Web Server**: Create a basic web server capable of serving static web pages. This project will help you understand how web servers work and handle HTTP requests.
